<h2>
Hello! I am Fahd Salendab, 16 yeas old and counting<p><p></h2>
I live in SPDA D.O.S Maguindanao, but when I was a kid we lived in Bulalo, Sultan Kudarat
in that place I was raised by my grandmother, because my parents that time are working abroad
so we did"nt spent most of our time way back. My mother is Sapia A. Salendab and my father is Rashid Salendab
they work in aboad for a longtime and they also meet there thats why we had are family, but now they ae both living with us 
they invest a business in Cotabato City to settle our finacial needs. My family is very happy and settled, we're complete and happy
, living in the same house, can express our feelings and problems in our parents, we can see our parents proud and happy because of 
us and that makes me feel complete and vey happy, seeing you're parents happy is very fulfilling, but even our family is happy we also faced many
problems, but it's okay because I believe that life is full or challenges, God/Allah are giving us problems to measure our faith and our determination 
to survive and to live, also I believe in a "live a life" this qoute makes me more careful or more appreciatable of life, as a human we need to live </th>
